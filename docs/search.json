This middle-aged concentration reflects hospital admission patterns during early pandemic waves. Central tendency centers around 46 years with moderate spread (SD \\(\\pm\\) 16)\n\n\nGender Composition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Gender Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly balanced gender representation, 55 males, 48 females) minimizes sampling bias, as shown in Figure 2. This equilibrium supports gender-stratified analyses without confounding by disproportionate representation.\n\n\nSurvival Pattern Analysis:\n\nAge-Survival Relationship:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Age Survival Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin plots, Figure 3, demonstrates clear age-outcome divergences: recovered patients peak at 30-50 years while non-recovered concentrate above 60 years. Survival rates decline sharply: 87%, &lt; 40 years, 57%, 40-60 years, and 24%, &gt; 60 years.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Survival percentages per Age Group\n\n\n\n| Age Group   |   Recovered % |   Not Recovered % |   n |\n|:------------|--------------:|------------------:|----:|\n| &lt;40         |          87.2 |              12.8 |  39 |\n| 40-60       |          57.1 |              42.9 |  35 |\n| &gt;60         |          24.1 |              75.9 |  29 |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Outcomes by Gender:\n\nGender-Survival Association:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Survival by Gender\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows proportional recovery rates (\\(\\pm\\) 59% overall) identical across genders despite higher raw non-recovery counts among males.\n\n\n\nClinical Trajectory Metics:\n\nHospital Length Stay:\nLength of Stay (LOS), Figure 5, reveal shorter median stays for recovered patients versus prolonged stays for non-recovered cases, reflecting disease severity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Length of Stay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVentilation and Treatment Analysis:\n\n\n\nTable 4: Ventilation and treatment analysis\n\n\n\n| Ventilated (Y/N)   |   Not Recovered |   Recovered |\n|:-------------------|----------------:|------------:|\n| No                 |             0   |       100   |\n| Yes                |            87.5 |        12.5 |\n| All                |            40.8 |        59.2 |\n\n\n\n\nVentilated patients showed a 70% mortality rate vs 35% mortality rate for the non-ventilated patients.\n\n\nClinical Variable Intercorrelations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Correlation Heatmap\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expanded heatmap, Figure 6, highlights strongest relationships: neutrophils - lymphocytes. Notable absent: age-outcome correlation due to categorical target encoding. Weak age associations with blood metrics suggest independent demographic effects.\n\n\n\nStatistical Hypothesis Testing:\n\n\nGender-Survival Chi-square: χ²=2.68, p=0.1016\n\n\nAge by Outcome T-test: t=-6.90, p=0.0000\n\n\n\nChi-square test for gender-survival association:\nA Chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relationship between patient gender and survival outcome.\nThe analysis produced \\(x^2\\) statistic of 2.68 with a corresponding p-value of 0.1016. Since the p-value is greater than the standard significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hyporhesis, that gender and survival are independent.\nThe statistical evidence suggests there is no significant association between a patient’s gender and their likelyhood of recovery within this specific data-set. This supports the visual observation from Figure 2 , indicating similar proportional outcomes for both males and females.\n\n\nT-Test for age difference by outcome:\nAn independent samples T-test was conducted to compare the mean age of patients who recovered versus those who did not recover.\nThe T-test yielded a T-statistic of -6.90 and an extremely low p-value. As the p-value is well below the 0.05 significance threshold, we reject the null hypothesis.\nThe negative T-statistic indicates that patients who recovered were, on average, younger than those who did not recover. This provides support for Figure 3 , highlighting age as a critical predictor of outcome in this cohort."

For this project, key variables of interest include TB_Incidence_Rate, TB_Mortality_Rate, GDP_Per_Capita, Health_Expenditure_Per_Capita, and BCG_Vaccination_Coverage, as these directly relate to potential drivers of disease prevaence outlined in the problem statement.\n\nData quality Assessment:\n\n\n\nTable 2: Confirmation of zero missing values across all 22 features, ensuring high data reliability.\n\n\n\nCountry                          0\nRegion                           0\nIncome_Level                     0\nYear                             0\nTB_Cases                         0\nTB_Deaths                        0\nTB_Incidence_Rate                0\nTB_Mortality_Rate                0\nTB_Treatment_Success_Rate        0\nDrug_Resistant_TB_Cases          0\nHIV_CoInfected_TB_Cases          0\nPopulation                       0\nGDP_Per_Capita                   0\nHealth_Expenditure_Per_Capita    0\nUrban_Population_Percentage      0\nMalnutrition_Prevalence          0\nSmoking_Prevalence               0\nTB_Doctors_Per_100K              0\nTB_Hospitals_Per_Million         0\nAccess_To_Health_Services        0\nBCG_Vaccination_Coverage         0\nHIV_Testing_Coverage             0\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nThis high quality is a significant advantage, as real-world health data is often messy. The completeness of the data for this analysis minimizes potential biases from imputation methods and strengthens the reliability of all subsequent findings and the predictive model’s accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: TB cases over time (2000 - 2024), illustrating persistent disparities between Asia / Africa (high) and North America / Europe (low).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe persistent disparity between high-burden regions (Asia, Africa) and low-burden regions (North America, Europe) underscores the critical need for targeted, context-specific interventions. This initial observation justifies a deeper dive into country-level socio-economic factors (e.g., GDP, health expenditure) to understand the drivers behind these regional differences, rather than just observing them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Annual TB cases in South Africa (2000 - 2024), showing fluctuation with a slight downward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Annual TB deaths in South Africa (2000 - 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 and Figure 3 provide a granular view of South Africa. While TB cases have fluctuated, there is a general trend of decreasing TB deaths since the early 2000s, indicating potential improvements in treatment efficacy or access to care.\nThe official death counts can be complex due to reporting issues (e.g., HIV and TB are often under-reported on death certificates).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Drug Resistant TB Cases observed in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: HIV Co-Infected TB Cases observed in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 and Figure 5 highlights the persistent challenges of drug-resistant TB and HIV co-infection within South Africa. The trends for HIV co-infected cases show considerable variability, with peaks around 2005 and 2015, suggesting a need for targeted interventions."

This insight is a key takeaway: increasing access to care is potentially the single most impactful structural intervention for reducing TB mortality, which can directly inform policy and resource allocation."

    "text": "Conclusion and Actionable Recommendations:\nThis exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling project successfully identified key drivers of tuberculosis prevalence in South Africa and forecasted potential future trends. The analysis highlights that South Africa, under its current trajectory, is not projected to meet the ambitious 80% TB incidence reduction target by 2030.\nKey Takeaways and Insights:\n\nThe strongest negative correlation was found between Access_To_Health_Services and TB_Deaths.\nGDP_Per_Capita and TB_Treatment_Success_Rate were significant features in predicting TB cases, along with general population density.\nThe high variability of HIV co-infected cases highlights a need for better integrated screening and treatment programs.\n\nNext Steps:\nFuture work will involve validating the insights found here by analyzing the official WHO Global TB Report dataset, as the current analysis utilizes a similar but separate dataset obtained via Kaggle. Additionally, future analysis could incorporate more granular geographic data to identify specific TB hotspots, perform cost-effectiveness analysis for the recommended interventions, or explore more advanced time-series models to refine long-term forecasting.\nLimitations:\n\nThe analysis utilized a dataset obtained via Kaggle, which is similar to but separate from the official WHO Global TB Report dataset. Future work would involve validating these insights against the official WHO data.\nThe correlation analysis and predictive modeling were specifically conducted using data only for South Africa, limiting the immediate generalizability of these specific findings to other countries or regions.\nOfficial death counts can be complex due to reporting issues (e.g., HIV and TB are often under-reported on death certificates), which may introduce some bias into the historical data.\nWhile a Random Forest Regressor was used, future analysis could explore more advanced time-series models to refine long-term forecasting accuracy.\n\n\nLicense and Data Usage Terms:\nThe underlying data used in this analysis, Tuberculosis Trends - Global & Regional Insights by Khushi Kyada is provided under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).\nAll original source code and analytical work presented in this project is released under the MIT License.
