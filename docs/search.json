The completeness of the data for this analysis minimizes potential biases from imputation methods and strengthens the reliability of all subsequent findings and the predictive model’s accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: TB cases over time (2000 - 2024), illustrating persistent disparities between Asia / Africa (high) and North America / Europe (low).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe persistent disparity between high-burden regions (Asia, Africa) and low-burden regions (North America, Europe) underscores the critical need for targeted, context-specific interventions. This initial observation justifies a deeper dive into country-level socio-economic factors (e.g., GDP, health expenditure) to understand the drivers behind these regional differences, rather than just observing them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Annual TB cases in South Africa (2000 - 2024), showing fluctuation with a slight downward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Annual TB deaths in South Africa (2000 - 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 and Figure 3 provide a granular view of South Africa. While TB cases have fluctuated, there is a general trend of decreasing TB deaths since the early 2000s, indicating potential improvements in treatment efficacy or access to care.\nThe official death counts can be complex due to reporting issues (e.g., HIV and TB are often under-reported on death certificates).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Drug Resistant TB Cases observed in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: HIV Co-Infected TB Cases observed in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 and Figure 5 highlights the persistent challenges of drug-resistant TB and HIV co-infection within South Africa. The trends for HIV co-infected cases show considerable variability, with peaks around 2005 and 2015, suggesting a need for targeted interventions."

This insight is a key takeaway: increasing access to care is potentially the single most impactful structural intervention for reducing TB mortality, which can directly inform policy and resource allocation."

The analysis highlights that South Africa, under its current trajectory, is not projected to meet the ambitious 80% TB incidence reduction target by 2030.\nKey Takeaways and Insights:\n\nThe strongest negative correlation was found between Access_To_Health_Services and TB_Deaths.\nGDP_Per_Capita and TB_Treatment_Success_Rate were significant features in predicting TB cases, along with general population density.\nThe high variability of HIV co-infected cases highlights a need for better integrated screening and treatment programs.\n\nNext Steps:\nFuture work will involve validating the insights found here by analyzing the official WHO Global TB Report dataset, as the current analysis utilizes a similar but separate dataset obtained via Kaggle. Additionally, future analysis could incorporate more granular geographic data to identify specific TB hotspots, perform cost-effectiveness analysis for the recommended interventions, or explore more advanced time-series models to refine long-term forecasting.\nLimitations:\n\nThe analysis utilized a dataset obtained via Kaggle, which is similar to but separate from the official WHO Global TB Report dataset. Future work would involve validating these insights against the official WHO data.\nThe correlation analysis and predictive modeling were specifically conducted using data only for South Africa, limiting the immediate generalizability of these specific findings to other countries or regions.\nOfficial death counts can be complex due to reporting issues (e.g., HIV and TB are often under-reported on death certificates), which may introduce some bias into the historical data.\nWhile a Random Forest Regressor was used, future analysis could explore more advanced time-series models to refine long-term forecasting accuracy.\n\n\nLicense and Data Usage Terms:\nThe underlying data used in this analysis, Tuberculosis Trends - Global & Regional Insights by Khushi Kyada is provided under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).\nAll original source code and analytical work presented in this project is released under the MIT License.
