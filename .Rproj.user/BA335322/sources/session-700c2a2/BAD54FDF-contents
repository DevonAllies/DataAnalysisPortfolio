With over 10 years of experience in immunology, bioinformatics, and computational biology, I specialise in tuberculosis research, clinical study coordination, and data-driven bioinformatics solutions.

As a Project Coordinator at the Division of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, I manage clinical research projects, streamline operations, and enhance data integrity while ensuring seamless stakeholder collaboration.

Key Highlights:
- Contributed to peer-reviewed research published in PubMed, BMC Infectious Diseases, with 62+ citations in the past five years.
- Developed an automated dashboard to improve data logging and retrieval for clinical studies.
- Expertise in flow cytometry, PBMC isolation, and immunological assay development in ISO-accredited labs.
- Skilled in Python, R, Power BI, SQL, Nextflow, and clinical data management.

I’m passionate about integrating bioinformatics and computational biology to drive scientific innovation and improve healthcare outcomes. Let’s connect!
